The <span class="blue1">j</span><span class="blue2">hoaf</span> Command-Line Tool<br/>
<span style="font-size:70%">The <span class="blue">jhoafparser</span>
Library for the Hanoi Omega-Automata Format (HOAF), version 1.1.1</span>
</h1>

<p>
The jhoafparser library provides a command-line interface to some of
the functionality. This can be roughly divided into two broad areas:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Validating</em> an automaton (no syntax errors, declared properties are correct, ...)</li>
  <li><em>Transforming</em> an automaton (translating from state- to transition-based acceptance, ...)</li>
</ul>


<p>We assume here that the reader is familiar with the basic concepts of
the <a href="http://adl.github.io/hoaf/">Hanoi Omega-Automata Format (HOAF)</a>.
</p>

<h2><a name="general">General</a></h2>

<h3>Obtaining and invoking the command-line tool</h3>
<p>
We assume here that you have either downloaded the JAR or ZIP file from the <a href="http://automata.tools/hoa/jhoafparser/">website</a>.
With the JAR file, the command-line tool can be invoked via</p>
<pre class="command">
java -jar jhoafparser-xx.yy.jar ...
</pre>
<p>
where <i>xx.yy</i> is the version.
For the ZIP file, the command-line tool can be invoked (on Linux or OS X)
from unpacked top-level directory via </p>
<pre class="command">
./jhoaf ...
</pre>

<p>
In the sequel, for simplicity we use the latter notation,
but you can substitute the invocation of the JAR file in
the following examples.
</p>

<h3>Getting Help</h3>
<p>With</p>
<pre class="command">
./jhoaf help
</pre>
<p>you'll obtain a brief description of the supported commands and
flags.</p>

<h3>Input / Output</h3>
<p>
The command-line tool reads the file(s) specified on the command-line, performs the required
processing and outputs the result to the standard output.
The hyphen character '-' can be used instead of the filename for reading from standard input.
Below, we provide some examples of invoking the command-line tool:
</p>

<p>
In the simplest case, the following command parses the automaton 
from automaton.hoa and prints the result
(the parsed automaton without comments, extra whitespace, etc) to the
console:
</p>

<pre class="command">
./jhoaf print automaton.hoa
</pre>

<p>
In the next example, we pipe the output of some other tool to the
input of jhoaf:
</p>

<pre class="command">
./some-hoa-producer | ./jhoaf print -
</pre>

<p>
The output can be captured as usual to a file using redirection:
</p>

<pre class="command">
./some-hoa-producer | ./jhoaf print - > result.hoa
</pre>

<p>
Note: Take care that you do not simultaneously read and write from/to the same file!
</p>

<h3>Commands and Flags</h3>
<p>
The general structure of invoking the command line-tool is
</p>
<pre class="command">
./jhoaf command flag(s) file(s)
</pre>

<h3>Multiple automata</h3>
<p>
The HOA format supports the streaming of automata, i.e., the ability to represent a
sequence of automata in a single file. This is useful when using tools as
a component in a pipe. You can specify multiple files on the command-line,
which will be read sequentially. Likewise, if there are multiple
automata in a file (or read from the standard input), they will be processed one after another.
</p>

<p>
Note: If there is an error in one of the automata, the command-line
tool will abort all processing!</p>

<h3>Exit value</h3>
<p>
If you want to use the command-line tool in scripts, the value returned by the tool on exit
is useful for diagnosing errors. The tool will return 0 for success/no errors. If there are
errors during the processing of the automata, the value 1 will be returned. If there are problems
with the invocation (invalid command-line arguments, ...), the value 2
will be returned.
</p>

<h2><a name="validating">Validating Automata</a></h2>

<p>To check that an automaton in HOA format can be successfully parsed, run
</p>
<pre class="commandWithOutput">
./jhoaf parse automaton-file.hoa
</pre>
<pre class="output">
Parsing OK
</pre>

<p>If everything went fine, the tool will output that parsing was OK,
otherwise there will be an error message indicating what went wrong.</p>

<p>Upon success, the automaton</p>
<ul>
  <li>has been successfully parsed (syntax conforms to the HOA
  format),</li>
  <li>properties specified in the header have been verified to be
  correct (violations of <em>state-labels</em>, <em>trans-labels</em>,
  <em>implicit-labels</em>, <em>explicit-labels</em>, <em>state-acc</em>,
  <em>trans-acc</em>, <em>no-univ-branch</em>, <em>colored</em> are currently detected;
  for the <em>deterministic</em> and <em>complete</em> properties, violations are
  currently only detected when implicit transition labels are used),
  </li>
  <li>if an <em>acc-name</em> header has been provided and is one
  of the standard acceptance conditions specified in the format, the
  correspondence with the <em>Acceptance</em> header has been verified
  </li>
  <li>the number, ordering and names of the states are valid with regard to
  the restrictions specified in the HOA format,
  </li>
  <li>if implicit transition labels are used, the required number is present,
  </li>
  <li>alias definitions are non-recursive and all aliases, atomic propositions and
  acceptance sets that are used are defined.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The semantic validations can be disabled by the command-line
option <span class="cmdline">--no-validate</span>. The following command
will only check the syntactic correctness according to the HOA format:
</p>
<pre class="command">
./jhoaf parse --no-validate automaton.hoa
</pre>

<h2>Transforming the Automaton</h2>

<h3>Pretty-printing the Automaton</h3>

<p>The simplest transformation is barely a transformation at all. Via</p>
<pre class="command">
./jhoaf print automaton-file.hoa
</pre>
<p>the automaton is simply parsed and printed back to the standard output.</p>
<p>
As comments and superfluous whitespace are ignored by the parser, this transforms the
automaton into some kind of canonical form, with the different elements of the HOA format
each placed on a single line.
</p>

<h3>Resolving Aliases</h3>
<p>
The command-line option <span class="cmdline">--resolve-aliases</span> activates a transformation
that (1) removes the <em>Alias:</em> <a class="explanationref" href="http://adl.github.io/hoaf/#alias" target="_blank">?</a>
definitions and (2) resolves all <em>@alias</em> references in
transition labels.</p>
<p>The following command reads the automaton, resolves the aliases and prints the resulting automaton:</p>
<pre class="command">
./jhoaf print --resolve-aliases automaton-file.hoa
</pre>

<p>
The option <span class="cmdline">--resolve-aliases</span>
can be used with all other commands and options.
</p>

<h3>Simple Transformations</h3>

<p>With the <span class="cmdline">--transform=<em>transform1,transform2,...</em></span> option,
one or more transformations can be specified. They will generally be
applied to the automaton in order.</p>

<p>Some of the transformations are applied <em>on-the-fly</em>, i.e., they are performed without first
having to parse and store the automaton in memory. Others are applied on the whole automaton, i.e., 
the automaton is first parsed, stored into memory and then manipulated.
If there is a mix of transformations, some that are on-the-fly and some that are not, the non-on-the-fly
transformation are batched first, applied in order and then, subsequently, the remaining on-the-fly
transformations are applied in order. Most of the time, the ordering should not matter.
</p>

<p>
The supported transformations are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>state-acc</b><br>
  Transform to state-based acceptance. This
  transformation is applied on the stored automaton. The acceptance on
  transitions are pushed to the successor state, which will in general
  increase the number of states in the automaton. If the automaton already
  only uses state-based acceptance, the transformation is skipped.
  </li>
  <li><b>trans-acc</b><br>
  Transform to transition-based acceptance.
  This transformation is applied on-the-fly.
  Acceptance on a state is combined with the acceptance on outgoing transitions.
  The number of states remains the same.
  </li>
  <li><b>explicit-labels</b><br>
  Transform to explicit labels.
  This transformation is applied on the stored automaton.
  Replaces implicit transition labels by explicit labels. This transformation will
  introduce aliases for each of the implicit edge labels.
  </li>
  <li><b>deduce-properties</b><br>
  Deduce properties and add in the <em>properties:</em> header. This
  transformation is applied on the stored automaton.
  Currently, the following properties will be deduced: 
  <em>state-labels</em>, <em>trans-labels</em>, <em>implicit-labels</em>,
  <em>explicit-labels</em>, <em>state-acc</em>, <em>trans-acc</em>,
  <em>univ-branch</em>, <em>no-univ-branch</em> and in some cases (only implicit labels)
  <em>deterministic</em>, <em>complete</em>.<br>
  This transformation is applied on the stored automaton.
  </li> 
  <li><b>deduce-accname</b><br>
  Tries to deduce one of the canonical acceptance conditions for the <em>acc-name</em> header.<br/>
  This transformation analyzes the <em>Acceptance</em>-header and checks whether
  a corresponding canonical <em>acc-name</em> can be used. If that is the case, 
  the automaton with the deduced <em>acc-name</em> header is output.<br>
  The acceptance conditions are tried in the following order:<br>
  <em>all</em>, <em>none</em>, <em>Buchi</em>, <em>co-Buchi</em>,
  <em>generalized-Buchi</em>, <em>generalized-co-Buchi</em>,
  <em>Rabin</em>, <em>Streett</em>.<br>
  The methods that are tried are the same as those described for the
  <a href="#convert-acceptance"><span class="cmdline">convert-acceptance</span></a>
  command described below.<br>
  This transformation is applied on-the-fly.</li>
  
  <li><b>dnf-acceptance</b><br>
  Transform <em>Acceptance</em> condition into DNF (disjunctive normal form),
  i.e., a top-level disjunction of conjunctions of acceptance atoms. This transformation is applied
  on-the-fly. Note that this transformation can incur an exponential blow-up in the size of the
  <em>Acceptance</em> condition.</li>
  
  <li><b>add-property(p)</b><br>
  Add property <em>p</em> to the automaton, where <em>p</em> can be any string.
  This transformation is applied on-the-fly.
  </li>
  
  <li><b>resolve-aliases</b><br>
  Resolves aliases, same as the <span class="cmdline">--resolve-aliases</span> option.
  Using the <span class="cmdline">--resolve-aliases</span> option will resolve aliases as
  the very first step, while explicitly specifying the transformation provides control over
  the point at which aliases are resolved.
  This transformation is applied on-the-fly.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="convert-acceptance">Transforming Between Acceptance Conditions</h3>
<p>
In some cases it is possible to transform an automaton from one acceptance condition
to another, without changing the underlying structure of the automaton. This is the case
if, for particular automaton, the acceptance conditions differ syntactically but can be easily
transformed:
</p>

<pre class="command">
./jhoaf convert-acceptance acceptance1,acceptance2,... automaton-file.hoa
</pre>

<p>Given one or more target acceptance conditions, attempts are made to transform the automaton
to the target conditions, in order. For example, a B&uuml;chi automaton will be easily transformed to
a Rabin automaton. The procedure is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>First the existing acceptance condition will be simplified, e.g.,
<span class="cmdline">Inf(0)|t</span> will be simplified to <span class="cmdline">t</span></li>
<li>
Then, an attempt is made to bring the acceptance condition into one of the specified canonical forms.
This can involve renaming, reordering or complementation of acceptance sets,
as well as introducing new acceptance sets (for true/false) to use in the more complex
acceptance conditions.</li>
<li>
The membership of transitions and states in the acceptance sets are then changed accordingly.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Note that this transformation relies only on the acceptance condition, no information about the use
of the acceptance sets in the automaton (on states/transitions) is taken into account.
</p>
<p>As an example, the acceptance condition</p>
<pre class="output">
Acceptance: 3 (Inf(2) | (Fin(0) &amp; Inf(!1))) &amp; t
</pre>
<p>would be transformed into the Rabin condition
(with <span class="cmdline">convert-acceptance Rabin</span>)</p>
<pre class="output">
Acceptance: 4 Fin(0) &amp; Inf(1) | Fin(2) &amp; Inf(3)
acc-name: Rabin 2
</pre>
by adding an empty acceptance set <span class="cmdline">0</span>,
renaming set <span class="cmdline">2</span> to <span class="cmdline">1</span>
and set <span class="cmdline">0</span> to <span class="cmdline">2</span>
and complementing set <span class="cmdline">1</span> to obtain set <span class="cmdline">3</span>.
The superfluous <span class="cmdline">&amp;&nbsp;t</span> is removed as well.

<h3>Converting to Generalized-B&uuml;chi Acceptance</h3>
<p>
For all deterministic or non-deterministic automata, we can convert to an equivalent
non-deterministic generalized-B&uuml;chi automaton, i.e., one with <span class="cmdline">acc-name: generalized-Buchi</span>.
This transformation is applied on the syntactical level and introduces several
copies of the automaton, each corresponding
to one way of satisfying the original acceptance condition.
</p>

<pre class="command">
./jhoaf convert-to-buchi automaton-file.hoa
</pre>

<p>
This transformation can be highly inefficient and is intended as a proof-of-concept
implementation and for the conversion of rather small automata.
</p>

<h2>Tracing, Implementation Details</h2>

<p>If you wish to implement your own transformations or want to use the jhoafparser library,
it might be interesting to play around with the <span class="cmdline">--trace</span> option:</p>

<pre class="command">
./jhoaf parse --trace automaton-file.hoa
</pre>

<p>
If activated, tracing will output the sequence of method calls into
the <em>HOAConsumer</em> by
the parser. This can be used to study the correspondence of syntactical elements in the
HOA format and the method calls.
</p>

<p>
The command-line utility is implemented in the
<span class="classname">jhoafparser.tools.JHOAFCmdLine</span> class. It relies on the various
<em>HOAConsumers</em> for the functionality and is a good entry-point for further investigations.
