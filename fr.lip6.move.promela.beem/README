Define tests in a tests.def file with format :
Title on one line followed by
Invocation string on one line

Do NOT put extra newlines at end of file.

Then run 
./collect_data.pl < tests.def
Which will build the "expected output" data files.
test_XXX.data
These are typically commited to svn.
You also get a file "data.info" that describes the machine that collected the control data.

To evaluate the actual tests run
./run_all.sh

NB : the syntax of the output is adapted to please teamcity continuous integration server.


**********
Files in this folder :

* test_models/   : carries the test data
* run_test.pl : run the tool, compare to expected, produce teamcity
style output
* run_all.sh : invokes run_test for every test*.data in current folder
* collect_data.pl : script to build the control data. Builds :
** data.info : log of machine/svn revision/date ...
** test_XX.data : trace of runs (supposedly correct control values)
